# missile-defender
Android app game which is a modern take on an 80's video game where the user defends their bases against
missile attacks. Incoming missiles appear from the top of the screen and head towards the bottom where they will
detonate, potentially destroying your bases. Launch interceptors to destroy the incoming missiles in
flight before they hit your bases! Game increases in difficulty as time passes.
